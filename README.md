# Linear systems calculator with steps in pure C++

This project is coursework for the linear algebra II course at Innopolis University. The requirements are to create a single C++ file that takes an (n by n) system of linear equations from standard input and outputs the steps to find the solution using the elimination method. see the [problem description](Problem_description.pdf) for more details.

## Value:
### Technical value:
I got the chance to apply advanced C++ topics such as OOP (Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism) and put them into practice, in addition to operator overloading, memory management (pointers), and others.
### Mathematical value:
Understood the elimination technique thoroughly.
